In the analysis of the Titanic dataset, the major question that arises is How many factors affected a person's survival rate? With the given data, this question was broken down into further branches.
A) Did individual characteristics played any role in the survival rate?
  1. Age
  2. Gender
  3. Adult or child
  4. Passenger Class
B) Which was the location a passenger embarked from? And is there a relation between the embarkment location and the class in which the passenger resided? Perhaps that may tell us something about that place's socio economic condition.
C) Did the survival rate depend on whether the person was travelling alone or with family? If with family, these were the factors:
                    1. Sibling
                    2. Parents
